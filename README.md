# Rover Exercise

This is example code for the rover exercise. It has multiple commits. Every commit refers to another stage of the refactoring. You can clone this repo and than type `git log` in your terminal. If you for example want to go back to the first version run `git checkout 9391778812a74f16c855e8c6ae68fcee7fad2a1a`. If you want to go to the first finished version without OOP principles run the "refactoring to OOP commit", which can be done by running `git checkout ad53fd5df59538f28d9c375e0b86ecc5cf51608d`.
